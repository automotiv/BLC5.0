It is usually beneficial, and even necessary, to use Sorl in a stand-alone mode. This is different than Embedded Solr because it allow Solr to run as a network service on its own or on a shared piece of hardware. This allows you to scale Solr independently. It allows all of your web application nodes to share a single Solr server. This is different than Embedded Solr because when Solr is embedded it does not run as a networked resource. It also does not let you query or manage it outside of the application. Stand-alone Solr allows for these things.
Installing a Stand Alone Solr Server

In order to use Solr in a stand-alone way, download the latest Solr distribution and unpack it to an appropriate location on the file system. Let's assume this is /path/to/solr-5.0.0 Then, do the following:
Create a folder, possibly outside of the Solr distribution, to hold configuration and index data. We'll call this solr.home, and can be assigned by using the -s flag when starting Solr. This is not the location of the installation, but of the data associated with a running instance. For purposes of illustration, let's assume that this is /path/to/solr/home
Copy the solr.xml file from /path/to/solr-5.0.0/server/solr/solr.xml to /path/to/solr/home/solr.xml
Create a directory called primary and another directory called reindex under /path/to/solr/home/
Under the primary directory, create a file called core.properties and add the following line to the file: name=primary
Under the primary directory create a folder called conf and another called data
Copy the solrconfig.xml file from your project's site/src/main/resources/solrconfig.xml to /path/to/solr/home/primary/conf/solrconfig.xml
Copy the schema.xml file from your project's site/src/main/resources/schema.xml to /path/to/solr/home/primary/conf/schema.xml
Under the reindex directory, create a file called core.properties and add the following line to the file: name=reindex
Under the reindex directory create a folder called conf and another called data
Copy the solrconfig.xml file from your project's site/src/main/resources/solrconfig.xml to /path/to/solr/home/reindex/conf/solrconfig.xml
Copy the schema.xml file from your project's site/src/main/resources/schema.xml to /path/to/solr/home/reindex/conf/schema.xml
Starting a Stand Alone Solr Server

Now that Solr has been generally configured, and has been specifically pre-configured with 2 cores (primary and reindex), each with their own copy of Broadleaf's solrconfig.xml and schema.xml, you can start the Solr server. To do so, you can cd to /path/to/solr-5.0.0/bin and execute the following command: ./solr -p 8983 -s /path/to/solr/home. This will start Solr on port 8983 and will tell Solr to use your newly configured Solr home directory for its configuration and data. Doing this also sets -Dsolr.home=/path/to/solr/home as a system property. This allows you to start multiple instances of Solr on a single machine, each pointing to a different solr.home directory. You can test your configuration by going http://localhost:8983/solr/primary/select?q=* or http://localhost:8983/solr/reindex/select?q=* in your browser, or using curl. This should return an empty result, assuming you don't have any data in your index. To stop Solr, you can cd to /path/to/solr-5.0.0/bin and call ./solr stop -p 8983. This stops the Solr server instance listening on port 8983.
